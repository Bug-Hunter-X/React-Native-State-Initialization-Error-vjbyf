This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: accessing state variables before they've been initialized. The `Bug.js` file shows the incorrect implementation, leading to the error.  The solution, found in `BugSolution.js`, demonstrates the proper way to handle state initialization using the `useEffect` hook.
